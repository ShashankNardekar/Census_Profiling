# Census Data Analysis

## Main Analysis
Please refer to the `Census_profile - Shashank.ipynb` file for the main data analysis and presentation.

## Models Utilized
I employed a few models for the analysis:

1. **Logistic Regression**
   
2. **Random Forest Classifier**

3. **LightGBM Classifier**

4. **XGBoost Classifier**

5. **Autoencoder + Neural Network Classifier**
   - This model combines an autoencoder for feature extraction with a neural network for classification.

6. **Stacked Majority Voting**
   - A combination of models where predictions are based on the majority vote of individual models.

7. **Stacked Mean Voting**
   - A combination of models where predictions are based on the mean of individual model predictions.

If you have any questions or need further details, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you!
